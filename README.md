# hello-world
Just my first repository

This is my first contact with github. i'm an architect trying to understand how programming works, to make a 180ยบ turn in my career.
And also, i've had sushi yesterday and it does not worth the money. So i'm pissed about having a R$140 sushi that made a hole in my wallet and it was "meh".
